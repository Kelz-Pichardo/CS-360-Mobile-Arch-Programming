Project entails coding an app with user authentication, database interaction, SMS messaging permissions, and creating a launch plan, showcasing user-centered design and industry best practices.

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I developed is designed to allow users to manage their inventory, events, or daily weight, depending on the option selected in Project One. The app addresses the need for users to easily track and manage their items, events, or weight, and to receive notifications when certain conditions are met, such as low inventory or an upcoming event.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app includes a login screen, a registration screen for new users, a main screen displaying the database information in a grid, and a settings screen for SMS messaging notifications. The UI design is user-centered, with intuitive navigation and clear labels for buttons and fields. The design keeps users in mind by providing a simple and straightforward interface that allows them to easily interact with the app and accomplish their tasks. The designs were successful because they were based on user needs and feedback, and they followed best practices for mobile app design.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the coding process by first reviewing the feedback from previous projects and incorporating necessary changes to the UI design. I then used Android Studio to write the Java code for the app, following the requirements and directions provided. I used the Android Emulator to test the code and ensure it was functional. I employed best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance the readability of the code. These techniques and strategies can be applied in future projects by following a similar approach, incorporating feedback, and adhering to best practices.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested the code using the Android Emulator feature of Android Studio. I tested the login and registration functionality, the database shell, and the SMS messaging notifications. I tested different scenarios, such as users with and without accounts, granting and denying permissions, and adding, deleting, updating, and reading items in the database. This process is important because it ensures that the app works as intended and that it is free of errors. It revealed any issues or bugs in the code that needed to be fixed before the app could be launched.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge I faced was handling the scenario where a user denies permission for SMS messaging notifications. I had to innovate by implementing a conditional logic that checks the user's response and makes the app function without the SMS messaging feature if permission is denied. This ensures that the app continues to work for all users, regardless of their permission settings.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was partly successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience in the development of the database shell. I was able to create a functional database that allows users to add, delete, update, and read items, and that stores user information persistently. I used SQLLite and followed best practices for database design and implementation. This component showcases my ability to develop a functional and user-centered mobile app.
